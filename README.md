# ml_util

This repo will include any classes or background utility for ML projects as I learn. Will likely continue to update this and continually clone for future projects. May include data structure/algorithms that already have native implementations in Python (e.g. MinHeap when there is heapq in Python). However they will be included for practice. These may vary from personal projects to topics covered in lectures.

Algorithms:
- A*: shortest path/lowest cost search ([Stanford CS221 lecture 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEs1ZCvLH2s)) [implementation](https://github.com/nathan-az/ml_util/blob/master/aStar.py) | [demonstration](https://github.com/nathan-az/ml_util/blob/master/aStar_demo.ipynb)
