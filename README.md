# basic_ml

This repo includes any practice implementations for AI/ML I complete. It may include data structure/algorithms that already have native implementations in Python (e.g. MinHeap when there is heapq in Python) if they are implemented for practice as well. These will likely align with topics covered in online lectures. More interesting/complicated/personal projects will lie in anotehr repo. Beneath I will ink the relevant files (and optionally demonstrations) as well as the lecture that covered the content.

Algorithms:
- A*: shortest path/lowest cost search ([Stanford CS221 lecture 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEs1ZCvLH2s)) [implementation](https://github.com/nathan-az/ml_util/blob/master/aStar.py) | [demonstration](https://github.com/nathan-az/ml_util/blob/master/aStar_demo.ipynb)
- SARSA on-policy reinforcement learning, using OpenAI toy ([Stanford CS221 lecture 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpaHTfY52RQ)) [implementation](https://github.com/nathan-az/basic_ml/blob/master/sarsa_frozenLake-v0.py)
- Q-Learning (with epsilon greedy policy), using OpenAI toy ([Stanford CS221 lecture 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpaHTfY52RQ)) [implementation](https://github.com/nathan-az/basic_ml/blob/master/qlearn_frozenLake-8x8.py)
